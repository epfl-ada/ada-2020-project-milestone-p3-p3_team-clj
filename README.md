# Project milestone 3 : creative extension

## Predicting betrayals in movies

### Abstract
In this project, we want to extend the work of the 'Linguistic harbingers of betrayal' study to another dataset, in another context. We train a model that will predict a betrayal in a relationship, using the dataset from the paper; then test this model on dialogues from famous movies in which a character betrays another and see if the results of the paper apply to movies, or if not, what makes the difference. Betrayals in movies often, if not always, surprise the "victim" character(s), but also the spectator. If the model performs well on the movie scripts, it would be an indicator that it may be relevant to use in other contexts ; if not, it would highlight the difference between a purely textual exchange as in the Diplomacy game, and a more complex situation, including body language, intonations and facial expressions.

### Research Questions
- predict betrayals in movies ?
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

### Proposed dataset
- dataset from the paper to train the model
- movie scripts (The Lion King, Interstellar, Matrix, Star Wars). Get from internet, as .txt. Select dialogues between betrayer and victim before betrayal.
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

### Methods
Proposed timeline
Organization within the team
A list of internal milestones up until project milestone P4. Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

### Questions for TAs (optional)
We think doing this project with movie scripts would be really interesting and a lot of fun, but maybe it's too complicated and ambitious, in which case, we thought about a "backup" project. Using the dataset from the paper, we could do an exploratory data analysis, looking at the distribution of the different features among the population of betrayers to see if there are different "profiles" of betrayers, and use a clustering method on the messages (maybe do a PCA then use k-means) to try to find different message types, and if certain types are mostly sent by betrayers.
